# brenbrenportfolio: Brenna Baker's coding portfolio

***

## Description: 
Meet me and learn about what kind of coding projects I have been up to.

## Usage:
* My about section provides some information on who I am and my professional background.
* Each dropdown contains a project and a small description of what it does.
* Follow the links to my Github page to see more details on the code.
* I have added comments wherever I can to clarify issues and decisions made during my process of writing the code.

## Support:
Contact me directly with your issues, and we can have a chat about it and make some changes!<br>
**Email:** brenna.langille@gmail.com

## Roadmap:
Considering I don't have any projects actually completed yet, there is a lot of room for growth.
* I plan to write another website called brenbrenbakes that contains many of the baking recipes I have been working on.
* I would like to create a card game that you can play and I plan on drawing each card individually and adding nice visuals.
* Another project I am considering is an app that helps you find places that are dog-friendly.
* Once I have achieved more projects in this program, I shall include them to the site as well.
* I want to add little stars the move around to the gradient background.
